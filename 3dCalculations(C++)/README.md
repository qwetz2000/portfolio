A small demo for the calculations involved in 3D translation, rotation, and scaling.

Created to streamline mathmatical calculations using a transform and handeling the rotation via quaternions.

A cube is given as an example shape.

Usage:

All generic mathematical functions and structs are found under src/include and can be included using  #include "include/quaternion.hpp" as a common header file.
Example use can be found in "demo.cpp". requires src/exampleEntity.hpp aswell as the aforementioned includes
